<h4>What is your interest in IT?</h4>
<p>My interest in IT stems right from an early age, I was always interested in little gadgets especially mobile devices. As I have grown so has my interests in IT to the point of where I see myself now, wanting to work direct in the IT industry. This is the next progression for myself, almost like I have graduated to the position due to my past experiences and interests. My goal within IT as of yet is wanting to get into cyber security. I'm interested in cyber security simply because I feel this is an area that will always require work as the constant threat of system breaches and stolen information is ever present. <br />

My long term and ultimate goal is working for the Australian Defence Force. This degree will enable me direct entry as a combat officer or entry into one of the various IT positions available at the ADF. This is a blend of two of my biggest passions in life, fitness and IT. I also want this degree to create a pathway for me moving over and living permanently in Melbourne. I’m currently living in Sydney, and landing a role within the IT industry in Melbourne will make my transition a lot smoother.</p>


<h4> When did you interest in IT start? </h4>
<p>I was always interested in IT, I just hadn’t realised it till recently. Right from the jump working for Vodafone in my teens, I was a telecommunication expert and nerd. I knew the in’s and outs of how to operate several mobile devices including Iphones, samsungs and various other Android devices like the HTC at the time. It was my job to stay educated on these matters and I thoroughly enjoyed it. This interest in IT was also enhanced by my older brother, we both we finatically for phones, at the time I had an HTC (which seems pretty ancient now) and I vowed to never switch to apple because I realised the capabilities of android devices over apple.

This interest has been fed and enhanced for most of my working life. I previously worked for NRMA insurance, I was in the claims department, I also created quotes and insurance policies. I was in regular contact with operational systems such as siebel, avaya etc. Had a brief stint with apple working as a phone technician and repairer. Working with apple I became a certified Iphone repair and really understood how to take apart an Iphone and put it back together again. This job led to the switch from a samsung device to an Iphone. 

As you can see IT as always been a huge influence and component in my life and stems from right when I was in my early teens. IT is the way forward and as careers are becoming redundant, IT is here to stay and is the future. </p>


<h4> Outline your IT expeirence </h4>
<p> Although I have no experience directly working in IT, I have worked in several companies that relied upon the heavy use of IT systems, I have also in my time worked and liaised with IT professionals in terms of dealing with certain matters and issues. I have assisted various customers in trouble shooting there technical issues and queries, ranging from mobile devices to operating certain software and hardware. I have acquired simple knowledge and skills that I believe will assist me in the IT industry.  </p>


<h4> Why did you choose RMIT? </h4>
<p> I was in Melbourne the weekend before I decided to enroll in this course at RMIT. While I was in Melbourne, I knew that I wanted to pursue this degree but didn’t know if I should study it face to face or online. One of my friends in Melbourne recently completed her masters in nursing online while she was working, she was the one who ultimately convinced me of studying this course online. I had a full time job so face to face classes would be super inconvenient. I asked around as there where several institutions running this course, and everyone I spoke to recommended studying this at RMIT.</p>


<h4> WHat do you expect to learn from your studies? </h4>
<p> I expect this course to be the platform that allows me direct entry into the IT field, I expect to learn the basics and take it from there. I expect this course to be the catalyst for future growth and success within the IT field. I expect this course to present other opportunities in IT that I never previously knew about. I expect from this course to grasp the basic understandings of what I require to enable me to being employable in the IT industry. I expect this course to test my desire for wanting to enter the IT field, I want this course to really push me to new levels.</p>
